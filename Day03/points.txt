What is oops and why do we need oops?

1. Encapsulation
2. Inheritance
3. Abstraction
4. Polymorphism


Python supports opps same as C++

1. can create a class same as C++
2. can create an object of a class that can access all the methods in the class same as C++


Class Method
-------------

In python we have two operators that is overloaded by default

+ - addition and concatenation

* - multiplication and to print a string n number of times

every operator in python is associated with a methods - __add__, __sub__, __mul__
we have slang for these methods - magic methods


@total_ordering
---------------
we should have overloaded two comparison operators 

in which one of the operator should be ==, __eq__ (comparison) mandatory


Overload all arithmetic operators
---------------------------------
a. add
b. sub
c. mul
d. div
e. floor_div


getter_method	- used to get the attributes of the class
setter_method	- used to change the attributes of the class
deleter_method  - used to delete attributes or set the value of the attributes to zero
